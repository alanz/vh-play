Step 1
------

Turn a Haskell program into a Blobs Document

a. One page per module, level changes defined by import graph.
b. Initial nodes are the top level things presented in the GHC
   ParsedModule
c. No Edges for now.

Step 2
------

TBD


Question: How to store the relationship between pages?

   (DFD & VH)


Two views

-  Import view, of module topography

-  Usage view: what actually uses what. i.e. at the function defn etc
   level
